    <h1>Method for Vinegar Titration</h1>
  <h2>Procedure for Part A</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place a weigh boat on the electronic balance and tare it to read zero.</li>
    <li>Use a spatula to measure 0.8g of Sodium Hydroxide into the weigh boat and record its mass. (This does not need to be exactly 0.8 g, but should be 0.8 Â± 0.1 g.)</li>
    <li>Wash the volumetric flask with deionised water from the wash bottle. Add the lid, shake the flask, and then tip the water down the sink. Repeat these two more times.</li>
    <li>Add a small volume (approximately 20 mL) of deionised water to the volumetric flask. (This will help to stop the NaOH clumping together and solidifying at the bottom of the flask.)</li>
    <li>Put the prewashed and dried funnel in the mouth of the volumetric flask. Add the NaOH to the volumetric flask by scraping it out of the weigh boat a small amount at a time. Ensure that the solid moves through the funnel and into the
      volumetric flask before adding more solid. Tap the funnel if the solid gets stuck. (Do not add water to wash it through - otherwise, the NaOH will clump together and become very difficult to remove.) When nearly all the solid is in the flask
      and only a small amount remains in the weigh boat and filter funnel, use the wash bottle to rinse the weigh boat into the funnel.</li>
    <li>Fill the volumetric flask to one-quarter full and swirl it until all the NaOH is dissolved. (This may take extra time if the powder clumps together and solidifies but it will dissolve eventually.)</li>
    <li>Add deionised water until the bottom of the meniscus is on the mark (this should be on the neck of the flask).</li>
    <li>Put the lid on the flask and tip the flask upside down and then upright again. Repeat this motion until the solution has an evenly distributed concentration.</li>
    <li>Label the flask 'NaOH', add its concentration, the date it was prepared and your initials.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Procedure for Part B</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Label three 100 mL beakers 'Washing deionised water', 'White vinegar' and 'NaOH' and fill each beaker with its respective solution.</li>
    <li>Wash three 100 mL conical flasks with deionised water and tip the waste down the sink.</li>
    <li>Wash the 10 mL pipette with the white vinegar by drawing the solution up to the mark and then dispensing it down the sink. Repeat this step two more times.</li>
    <li>Using the pipette, dispense 10 mL of the white vinegar solution into the conical flask. Repeat this step two more times so that all three conical flasks contain a 10 mL aliquot of white vinegar. Add three drops of phenolphthalein indicator
      to each conical flask.</li>
    <li>Close the stopcock of the burette and wash it with deionised water from the wash bottle by adding some water and gently tipping the burette onto its side, then slowly
    <li>Repeat Step 5, using no more than 10 mL of the standard NaOH solution. Dispose of the solution in the waste beaker, not down the sink. This wash only needs to be performed once</li>
    <li>Set up the burette and clamp.</li>
    <li>Place the 250 mL beaker under the burette (to collect the waste) and a funnel on the top. With the stopcock open, pour in the standard solution until no more than 1-2 mL has run through. Then close the stopcock and fill the burette to the
      top. (Note: You do not need to fill the burette to the 0.00 mL line. You will measure a final and initial volume, so it does not matter what value it starts on, as long as it is below 5 mL.) Remove the funnel from the top. Record the initial
      volume in the burette.</li>
    <li>
      Place the first conical flask under the burette and carefully open the stopcock. As the NaOH mixes with the white vinegar solution, constantly swirl the flask to turn the yellow to green. (If the solution turns blue, the titration has gone
      too far. This end point can be difficult to observe. Take your time, use the white tile and be careful.) Turn the stopcock so that the NaOH solution is dispensed at a slower rate. When reaching the end point (colour change from red to
      orange), the tap should be slowly dispensing one drop at a time. The white tile will help you to observe this colour change.
    </li>
    <li>Record the final volume in the burette. Subtract the initial volume from the final volume to
      calculate the titre volume.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat Steps 9 and 10 until concordant titres (highest and lowest values within 0.1 mL) are obtained. Note: One drop is the equivalent of 0.05 mL, so it is important that your measuring is highly accurate throughout the experiment.

    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat all steps, but replacing the white vinegar with double strength white vinegar.
    </li>
